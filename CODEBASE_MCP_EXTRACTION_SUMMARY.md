## Integration Examples

### Nancy Query Processing
**User Query**: "Who wrote the authentication module and what's its complexity?"

**Nancy Orchestration**:
1. **Query Analysis**: Linguistic Brain identifies code-related query
2. **Server Routing**: MCP Host routes to Codebase MCP Server
3. **Multi-Step Processing**: 
   - AST analysis finds authentication-related functions
   - Git analysis identifies primary authors
   - Complexity calculation provides metrics
4. **Knowledge Packet Generation**: Vector, analytical, and graph packets created
5. **Response Synthesis**: Linguistic Brain combines results into natural language

**Response**: "The authentication module consists of 3 main functions written primarily by Jane Smith (67% of lines) with contributions from 2 other developers. The module has a complexity score of 23, indicating moderate complexity due to multiple authentication pathways and error handling."
