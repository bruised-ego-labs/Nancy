Project Overview: The "Nancy" Collaborative AI Librarian
Document Version: 1.3
Date: July 21, 2025
1. Vision & Objective
1.1. The Vision: The End of Context-Switching
In the modern workplace, our most valuable asset—the focused attention of our team members—is constantly under assault. Knowledge workers spend countless hours searching for documents, piecing together conversation histories, and rebuilding context every time they switch tasks. This is a massive, hidden tax on productivity and innovation.
Our vision is to eliminate this tax. We envision a future where every team member, both human and AI agent, has immediate, intelligent access to the full context of their work, delivered proactively and seamlessly. In a world where AI can provide answers, our competitive advantage will come from providing the right answers, grounded in the specific, nuanced, and evolving reality of our own organization's knowledge.
1.2. The Project Objective: Build "Nancy"
To realize this vision, our objective is to build "Nancy," a collaborative AI agent that creates, manages, and provides access to a persistent, project-specific knowledge base.
Nancy is not another system to be managed. She is designed to be a helpful, autonomous teammate. You invite her to meetings, CC her on important emails, and add her to key conversations. In return, she builds a rich, interconnected "organizational memory" for the project, making its collective knowledge instantly accessible to everyone on the team. This project will leverage and extend our existing AI-Dev-Framework to serve as the primary user interface and orchestration engine.
2. Architecture: Federated Expertise
We will adopt a federated "Branch Library" architecture. This model provides the security and focus of isolated project instances while allowing for the sharing of core intelligence and high-level insights across the organization.

2.1. The "Project Nancy" Instance (The Branch Library)
For each project, we will deploy a dedicated, self-contained "Nancy" instance. This is the core building block of the system.
Isolation & Security: Each instance has its own private data stores. Access is restricted to the project team, ensuring sensitive information is never co-mingled.
Contextual Focus: Each Nancy becomes a deep subject matter expert on its specific project, ensuring high relevance.
Technology Stack:
Orchestrator & UI: Our existing AI-Dev-Framework (Node.js) will serve as the user-facing chat interface and the orchestration engine that communicates with Nancy's backend services.
Structured & Vector Storage: DuckDB. We have chosen DuckDB for its power and simplicity. It is a high-performance, file-based analytical database that eliminates the need for a separate server. Its vector search extensions (vss) allow us to manage both structured facts and semantic embeddings in a single, easy-to-version file, dramatically simplifying the stack for an MVP.
Graph Storage (Relational Context): Neo4j. As the market leader in native graph databases, Neo4j is the ideal choice for modeling the complex relationships between people, projects, decisions, and data. Its intuitive Cypher query language and excellent visualization tools will be critical for building and debugging the project's knowledge graph.
Backend Logic: The core data processing, NLP, and analysis logic will be built as a suite of Python services.
2.1.1. Service Access Strategy: API-First with MCP Wrapper
To ensure maximum interoperability and a robust architecture, Nancy's services will be designed with an API-first approach.
Core API: The fundamental logic for managing a knowledge library (ingesting data, querying, versioning) will be exposed via a standard, protocol-agnostic REST or gRPC API. This allows any system capable of making a standard API call—including other AI agent frameworks or custom scripts—to interact with a Nancy instance directly. This is the key to making Nancy a reusable, standalone asset.
Lightweight MCP Adapter: For seamless, native integration with our AI-Dev-Framework, we will build a simple MCP server that acts as a wrapper around the core API. This adapter's sole responsibility is to translate MCP requests from the orchestrator into standard API calls to the core Nancy service and return the response. This gives us the best of both worlds: a powerful, independent service and a first-class integration experience within our flagship framework.
2.2. The Organizational Layer (The Central Catalog)
This is a lightweight central service that does not store sensitive project data. Its role is to manage shared intelligence.
Deployment Templates: A master Docker Compose configuration for deploying new, consistent Nancy instances.
Shared AI Models: A central repository for the core AI models (e.g., for summarization, entity extraction) that each Nancy instance will use.
Knowledge Federation Server: An index of all active and archived Nancy instances. It knows what projects exist and holds high-level, non-sensitive metadata about them.
3. Workflow & Lifecycle
3.1. Deployment & Ingestion
A new Nancy instance is deployed for each project. Data ingestion is designed to be low-friction and collaborative:
Proactive, Event-Driven Capture: Nancy will be connected via webhooks to key project tools (e.g., GitHub, Jira). She will autonomously ingest commit messages, issue updates, and other structured events.
Collaborative Inclusion: Team members will invite Nancy to meetings (where she will transcribe the discussion), CC her on important emails (nancy.project-phoenix@ourcompany.com), and add her to key Slack/Teams channels.
3.2. Lifecycle: Active Archival
To preserve context without incurring high costs, we will use an "Active Archival" model.
When a project concludes, its Nancy instance is transitioned to a read-only state.
The active compute services are spun down, but the data stores (DuckDB file, Neo4j database) are preserved in their entirety.
This creates a permanent, high-fidelity, searchable archive of the project's complete history, accessible to future teams facing similar challenges.
4. Keys to User Adoption
Technology alone will not make this project a success. Adoption will be driven by a relentless focus on the human experience.
Seamless User Experience (The "Nancy" Persona): Our primary interface is a conversation with a helpful teammate, not a complex dashboard. The personification of the system as "Nancy" is critical for lowering social friction and managing expectations.
Immediate Personal Value: To overcome the inertia of "another thing to do," Nancy must provide immediate, personal benefits. The "private scratchpad" concept is key here, where Nancy assists an individual developer with their immediate task, making their job easier before asking them to contribute to the team's knowledge base.
Zero-Friction Data Capture: The emphasis on proactive, event-driven data capture from existing tools is paramount. The system should adapt to the team's workflow, not the other way around.
5. Core Development Tools
Source Control: GitHub will be used for all code, including the Node.js orchestrator and the Python MCP servers.
Environment Management: Docker and Docker Compose are essential. They will allow us to define the entire Nancy stack (UI, Python servers, databases) in a single configuration, enabling one-command setup for development and deployment.
Data Versioning: DVC (Data Version Control) will be used to version the large data files (DuckDB, Neo4j snapshots) alongside the Git history, ensuring full reproducibility of the Librarian's state.
6. Development Plan & Milestones
We will follow an iterative approach, delivering value at each stage.
M1: Core Librarian Services (Prototype)
Goal: Build the foundational Python services and their core API.
Tasks:
Create a service that can initialize a DuckDB file with vector search enabled.
Create a service that can initialize a Neo4j instance.
Develop basic API endpoints for adding and querying data in each.
Testing: Test services via direct API calls and scripts. Validate that data is stored and retrieved correctly.
M2: "Nancy" Persona MVP (Alpha)
Goal: Integrate the core services with the AI-Dev-Framework via a lightweight MCP adapter.
Tasks:
Build the MCP wrapper that calls the M1 API endpoints.
Connect the chat UI to the MCP wrapper.
Implement basic data ingestion via file upload in the chat.
Enable users to ask simple questions and receive answers synthesized from the stored data.
Testing: A single user can start a new Nancy instance, upload a few documents, and ask questions about their content.
M3: Proactive Ingestion (Beta)
Goal: Make Nancy an autonomous observer.
Tasks:
Implement webhook integration with GitHub. Nancy can now ingest commit messages and code changes automatically.
Implement meeting transcription by allowing Nancy to be "invited" to calls.
Testing: Run a mock project workflow. Verify that Nancy autonomously creates a knowledge graph linking commits, developers, and meeting decisions without manual data entry.
M4: Advanced Features & Hardening (V1 Release)
Goal: Implement the systems needed for long-term trust and maintainability.
Tasks:
Implement the "Trust Tier System" for relationship approval.
Build the "Active Archival" lifecycle process.
Develop the "Advanced Toolkit" UI for project librarians.
Testing: Test the end-to-end lifecycle of a project, from creation to archival. Verify that the review and governance tools work as expected.
7. Use Case Examples
a) Product Development Services Team: Nancy is invited to customer calls and ingests the transcripts. She links customer feature requests to internal Jira tickets and tracks the hardware specs in the design documents. When a software engineer works on a feature, they can ask Nancy, "Show me the original customer conversation that prompted this feature request and the latest hardware schematics for the target device."
b) Remote Power Backup Service Team: Nancy ingests real-time alerts from IoT sensors, maintenance reports from field technicians (via a simple email alias), and the system's technical documentation. When a technician is dispatched, they can ask Nancy on their phone, "What was the complete service history for unit #78B, and what were the last three alerts it generated?"
c) Cancer Lab Research Team: Nancy is connected to the lab's electronic notebook and a feed of new research papers from PubMed. She links experimental results to the specific hypotheses they were designed to test. A researcher can ask, "Have any other experiments in the lab shown a similar protein expression pattern, and are there any newly published papers that cite the methodology we are using?"
8. Guiding Principles for Development
8.1. Don't Reinvent the Wheel
Our core innovation is not in creating a new database or a new NLP library from scratch. Our unique value is in the intelligent integration of existing, best-in-class tools and the creation of the seamless "Nancy" persona that makes these tools accessible and powerful for our teams.
Therefore, a primary directive for the development team is to aggressively leverage the open-source ecosystem. Before building a new component, the first step is always to search for existing, battle-tested libraries or services that solve the problem. This allows us to focus our development energy on the parts of the system that are truly unique to our vision.
When selecting external tools, we will prioritize those with permissive, commercially-friendly licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to ensure maximum flexibility for our future.
9. Proposed File Architecture
To ensure the project is modular and scalable, we propose the following high-level directory structure. This separates the concerns of the UI/Orchestrator from the core Librarian services and promotes a clean, maintainable codebase.

Filesystem Compatibility
The core services will be designed to be filesystem-agnostic by using Python's standard os and pathlib libraries. Specific integrations for cloud filesystems (e.g., Google Drive, S3) or local systems (Windows paths) will be encapsulated within dedicated modules in the /connectors/ directory. This ensures the core logic remains portable and clean.
10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: What happens if the AI makes a mistake or a relationship is wrong?
A: This is a critical concern. We address it with our "Trust Tier System." High-confidence information is auto-approved, but lower-confidence or ambiguous inferences are placed in a "review queue." A designated human "Project Librarian" can then quickly validate these suggestions via an advanced toolkit, ensuring a human always has final say over the knowledge graph's integrity.
Q: How do you prevent the knowledge base from becoming stale or full of "digital ghosts"?
A: We have designed a core maintenance function called retire_source. When a source document is deleted or superseded, this function is called to perform "garbage collection," removing all associated data—vectors, structured facts, and graph relationships—from the library. This, combined with our "Active Archival" lifecycle, ensures the knowledge base remains current and trustworthy.
Q: Why not just build one giant Nancy for the whole company?
A: A single, monolithic system would fail due to security, context, and complexity. Our federated model provides:
Security: Project data is strictly isolated, preventing cross-contamination or unauthorized access.
Relevance: Each Nancy becomes a deep expert on its specific project, avoiding the noise and ambiguity of a massive, organization-wide data pool.
Simplicity: It is far easier to manage, deploy, and archive small, independent instances than to maintain one enormous, interconnected system.
Q: How will this system handle the "human element" of politics and resistance to change?
A: We are designing for this explicitly. Our approach is human-centric:
Focus on Personal Value: Nancy must first make an individual's job easier (the "private scratchpad" concept). When users see immediate personal benefit, they are more likely to adopt the tool for team benefit.
Low-Friction Adoption: Nancy integrates into existing workflows (email, Slack, Git) rather than forcing new ones.
Radical Transparency: To mitigate politics, the system is built on a foundation of immutable logs and universal attribution. Every piece of data is tied to its source and author, making the record auditable and difficult to manipulate.
Q: What if our team doesn't want to do the extra work of "feeding" Nancy?
A: They won't have to. The goal is to make data capture a passive byproduct of work they are already doing. By connecting Nancy to webhooks from GitHub, Jira, and other tools, she becomes a proactive observer. For other sources, the effort is minimal (e.g., CC'ing an email address). The system is designed to be so helpful that not including her would be a disadvantage.

Comments from Claude Developer:
I'll search for information about Project Nancy and the AI-Dev-Framework to provide you with a comprehensive evaluation.Based on my analysis of Project Nancy and the lessons learned from the AI-Dev-Framework, here's my comprehensive evaluation:
Project Nancy Evaluation: Strengths & Concerns
✅ Strong Foundation Elements
Clear Value Proposition: Nancy addresses a real pain point - the "hidden tax" of context-switching and knowledge fragmentation in teams. The vision of eliminating context rebuilding is compelling and measurable.
Smart Architecture Decisions:
Federated model prevents security/complexity issues of monolithic systems
API-first approach ensures Nancy can integrate with any framework, not just AI-Dev-Framework
File-based storage (DuckDB/Neo4j) simplifies deployment and versioning
Proactive data capture reduces adoption friction
Human-Centric Design: The "Nancy persona" approach is psychologically sound - people collaborate better with entities that feel like teammates rather than tools.
🚨 Critical Lessons from AI-Dev-Framework
The AI-Dev-Framework experience reveals several patterns Nancy must avoid:
1. Architecture Complexity Creep
AI-Dev-Framework Issue: The orchestrator became a 1,932-line "god object" handling everything
Nancy Risk: The MCP adapter could become a similar bottleneck if not properly designed
Mitigation: Enforce strict separation between the MCP wrapper and core services
2. Context Management Challenges
AI-Dev-Framework Issue: Context management required touching the entire codebase
Nancy Risk: Knowledge graph context could become similarly scattered
Mitigation: Design centralized context management from day one
3. Integration Complexity
AI-Dev-Framework Issue: Each new feature required orchestrator modifications
Nancy Risk: New data sources could require core service changes
Mitigation: The connector pattern is well-designed to prevent this
Specific Recommendations for Nancy
1. Start with Minimal Viable Nancy (MVN)
Rather than building all four milestones, focus on proving core value first:
Week 1-2: Single-user Nancy
- File upload + basic Q&A only
- Skip webhooks, meetings, email initially
- Focus on making the core knowledge graph brilliant

Week 3-4: Team validation
- Add one proactive source (GitHub commits)
- Test with 2-3 internal teams
- Measure actual time saved vs. time invested
2. Strengthen the Service Boundary
Make the Core API Truly Independent:
# Good: Clean, framework-agnostic API
POST /nancy/projects/{project_id}/ingest
GET /nancy/projects/{project_id}/query?q="customer requests"

# Avoid: MCP-specific or AI-Dev-Framework coupled endpoints
Benefits:
Nancy becomes a standalone product
Multiple UIs can connect (web, CLI, mobile)
Easier testing and debugging
Clear upgrade path if AI-Dev-Framework evolves
3. Address Adoption Friction Early
Personal Value First Strategy:
Individual Scratchpad: Nancy helps with personal note-taking before team knowledge
Immediate Payoff: Must save time within the first day of use
Gradual Expansion: Start with read-only team features, expand to collaboration
Example User Journey:
Day 1: "Nancy, remember this client requirement from today's call"
Day 3: "Nancy, what did we decide about the authentication approach?"
Week 2: "Nancy, find all conversations about the security review"
Month 1: Team members start asking Nancy instead of interrupting each other
4. Learn from AI-Dev-Framework's Module Success
The AI-Dev-Framework's lib/ modules (context-manager, schema-sanitizer) are its most successful components. Nancy should:
Use the same modular approach for core functions
Leverage existing modules (especially context-manager.js)
Build connectors as independent modules for easier testing
5. Solve the "Digital Ghost" Problem Proactively
Active Source Tracking:
class SourceManager:
    def register_source(self, source_path, last_modified):
        # Track all ingested sources
    
    def detect_stale_sources(self):
        # Find sources that no longer exist
    
    def retire_source(self, source_path):
        # Clean up all associated data
This was a major lesson from AI-Dev-Framework - inactive code/configurations became technical debt.
Success Probability Assessment
High Probability Factors:
Strong technical foundation from AI-Dev-Framework experience
Clear user problem and measurable value
Smart federated architecture prevents common scaling issues
Focus on existing workflow integration
Risk Factors:
Adoption requires behavior change (CC'ing Nancy, inviting to meetings)
Multiple data sources increase complexity quickly
Knowledge quality depends on team discipline
Competition from existing tools (Notion, Confluence, etc.)
Bottom Line Recommendation
Proceed with Nancy, but apply AI-Dev-Framework lessons aggressively:
Start smaller - build MVN before full vision
Keep the core API independent - don't couple to AI-Dev-Framework
Design for modularity from day one
Focus on personal value before team collaboration
Build robust source management to prevent data quality issues
Project Nancy has excellent potential, but only if it avoids the complexity traps that affected AI-Dev-Framework. The federated architecture and API-first approach show you've learned the right lessons.

Query Strategy Examples
Strategy 1: Vector-First (Semantic Focus)
def vector_first_strategy(query):
    # 1. Vector search for semantic matches
    # 2. Use vector results to guide analytical queries
    # 3. Use entities from both to explore graph relationships
Strategy 2: Graph-First (Relationship Focus)
def graph_first_strategy(query):
    # 1. Extract entities and explore graph relationships
    # 2. Use graph context to refine vector searches
    # 3. Analytical queries for quantification and validation
Strategy 3: Analytical-First (Data Focus)
def analytical_first_strategy(query):
    # 1. Analytical queries for metrics and trends
    # 2. Vector search within analytical result sets
    # 3. Graph exploration of interesting analytical findings
Evaluation Framework
Query Quality Metrics
class QueryEvaluation:
    def measure_relevance(self, query, results, ground_truth):
        # Precision, recall, F1 score
        
    def measure_completeness(self, query, results):
        # How much context was provided vs. available
        
    def measure_accuracy(self, query, results, expert_validation):
        # Expert assessment of answer correctness
        
    def measure_efficiency(self, query, execution_time, database_usage):
        # Performance vs. single-database approaches

Risk Mitigation
Technical Risks
Database Synchronization: Implement transactional ingestion to keep all three databases consistent
Performance Degradation: Use query caching and smart database selection to optimize response times
Complexity Explosion: Strict API boundaries and comprehensive testing for each database layer
Strategic Risks
Insufficient Value Demonstration: Focus on queries that clearly showcase hybrid benefits
Adoption Resistance: Start with developers who understand the technical value proposition
Resource Requirements: Monitor and document actual computational and storage requirements
Validation Risks
Confirmation Bias: Include queries where single-database approaches might outperform hybrid
Test Data Limitations: Supplement curated test data with real, messy organizational data
Scale Assumptions: Test with varying data volumes to understand scaling characteristics

Success Definition
Technical Success
Nancy MVN demonstrates that combining vector, analytical, and graph databases creates measurably better knowledge discovery than any single approach.
Strategic Success
The team gains confidence that the three-database strategy justifies the additional complexity and provides a foundation for full Nancy development.
User Success
Knowledge workers using Nancy MVN find information faster and with more context than their current tools, leading to demonstrable time savings and better decision-making.

Next Steps After MVN
If the three-database strategy proves successful:
Architecture Scaling: Design for multi-project federation
Advanced Features: Proactive ingestion, meeting transcription, email integration
Production Hardening: Security, backup, monitoring, user management
Commercial Validation: Broader team deployments and ROI measurement
The MVN phase is specifically designed to validate our core technical hypothesis before committing to the full vision. Success here provides a solid foundation for the complete Nancy system.
