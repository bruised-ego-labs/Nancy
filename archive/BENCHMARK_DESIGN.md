# Nancy Four-Brain Architecture Benchmark Design

## Overview

This benchmark evaluates Nancy against established knowledge management baselines using both quantitative metrics (RAGAS-inspired) and real-world enterprise scenarios (APQC-based).

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. RAGAS-Adapted RAG Evaluation

**Traditional RAGAS Metrics Adapted for Nancy:**

| Metric | Nancy Four-Brain Evaluation | Single-System Baseline |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Faithfulness** | % of factually correct statements in LLM-synthesized responses across all four brains | % correct from vector search alone |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Relevance of multi-brain orchestrated responses to user queries | Relevance of single-modality responses |
| **Context Precision** | Signal-to-noise ratio when combining Vector + Analytical + Graph contexts | Precision of isolated vector contexts |
| **Context Recall** | % of relevant information retrieved across all dimensions (semantic, metadata, relationships) | % retrieved from single dimension |

**Nancy-Specific Metrics:**
- **Decision Provenance Accuracy**: % of decision-context queries correctly traced to makers and influences
- **Knowledge Expert Identification**: Precision/recall of subject matter expert identification vs. human judgment
- **Temporal Context Preservation**: Accuracy of timeline-based queries vs. chronological ground truth
- **Cross-Brain Synthesis Quality**: Coherence of responses combining multiple brain outputs

### 2. Enterprise Knowledge Management Benchmarks (APQC-Based)

**Productivity Metrics:**
- **Information Search Time**: Average time to find specific information (target: <30 seconds vs. industry 3.6 hours daily)
- **Context Reconstruction Speed**: Time to rebuild project context after interruption
- **Knowledge Transfer Effectiveness**: Success rate of onboarding new team members
- **Decision Context Recovery**: Time to understand historical decision rationale

**Data Quality Metrics:**
- **Information Currency**: % of results that reflect current project state
- **Source Attribution Accuracy**: Correct identification of information authors/contributors
- **Relationship Mapping Completeness**: % of actual project relationships captured
- **ROT Elimination**: Reduction in Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial information retrieval

## Benchmark Implementation

### Test Dataset Creation

**Multi-Domain Engineering Project Simulation:**
- 50 technical documents (requirements, design, test results)
- 25 meeting transcripts with decisions and attendees
- 30 email threads with cross-functional discussions
- 15 project timeline documents with phase information
- Ground truth annotations for:
  - Decision makers and influences
  - Subject matter experts by domain
  - Feature-decision relationships
  - Collaboration networks

**Realistic Query Categories:**
1. **Decision Archaeology**: "Why was technology X chosen over Y?"
2. **Expert Identification**: "Who should I talk to about thermal constraints?"
3. **Impact Analysis**: "What features will be affected by changing component Z?"
4. **Timeline Context**: "What decisions were made during Q3 integration phase?"
5. **Collaboration Mapping**: "How do mechanical and electrical teams coordinate?"

### Baseline Comparisons

**Tier 1: Single-Solution Systems**
- Pure Vector Search (ChromaDB alone)
- File System Search (Windows Search/grep)
- Traditional Wiki/Confluence search
- SQL Database queries (metadata only)
- LLM Summarization (without retrieval augmentation)

**Tier 2: Enterprise KM Systems**
- Microsoft SharePoint with AI search
- Notion AI with semantic search
- Obsidian with graph view
- Roam Research with bidirectional links

**Tier 3: RAG Systems**
- LangChain + vector store
- LlamaIndex with single embedding model
- Semantic Kernel with traditional RAG

### Evaluation Protocol

**Phase 1: Automated Metrics (40 hours processing time)**
- Ingest standardized dataset across all systems
- Execute 100 pre-defined queries per system
- Measure RAGAS metrics and response times
- Calculate precision/recall for decision provenance
- Assess cross-brain synthesis quality

**Phase 2: Human Evaluation (20 expert hours)**
- Domain experts evaluate response quality blind
- Rate usefulness for actual engineering decisions
- Assess completeness of context reconstruction
- Measure cognitive load for information synthesis

**Phase 3: Longitudinal Usage Study (2 weeks)**
- Deploy systems to real engineering teams
- Track daily usage patterns and outcomes
- Measure productivity impact on actual work
- Document failure modes and edge cases

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative Thresholds:**
- **Faithfulness**: >85% (vs. <70% for single systems)
- **Answer Relevancy**: >90% (vs. <75% for baselines)
- **Decision Provenance Accuracy**: >80% (vs. 0% for non-graph systems)
- **Information Search Time**: <30 seconds average (vs. >2 minutes for baselines)
- **Context Reconstruction**: <2 minutes (vs. >30 minutes manual process)

**Qualitative Success Indicators:**
- Engineers prefer Nancy for complex project questions
- Successful onboarding of new team members using Nancy
- Reduction in "lost context" incidents during team transitions
- Measurable decrease in repeated decision discussions

## Benchmark Test Data Requirements

**To execute this benchmark, we need:**

1. **Realistic Engineering Dataset**: 
   - Multi-disciplinary project documents
   - Meeting notes with decision rationale
   - Email threads showing collaboration
   - Timeline documents with phase markers

2. **Ground Truth Annotations**:
   - Expert-validated decision relationships
   - Verified subject matter expert mappings
   - Confirmed collaboration networks
   - Temporal accuracy validation

3. **Expert Evaluators**:
   - Senior engineers familiar with project context
   - Knowledge management professionals
   - Technical writers who understand documentation quality

4. **Control Systems**:
   - Identical hardware/computational resources
   - Standardized query sets
   - Blind evaluation protocols
   - Statistical significance testing

## Expected Results

**Hypothesis**: Nancy's four-brain architecture will significantly outperform single-solution systems on complex knowledge tasks while maintaining competitive performance on simple lookup tasks.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Complex Queries**: 2-3x improvement in decision context accuracy
- **Expert Identification**: 5-10x improvement in precision vs. keyword search
- **Cross-Domain Questions**: Only Nancy can synthesize across technical domains
- **Temporal Context**: Only graph-based systems preserve decision timelines
- **Zero-Cost Operation**: Only Nancy eliminates ongoing LLM API costs

This benchmark design provides both quantitative rigor (RAGAS-based metrics) and real-world validity (enterprise KM scenarios) to demonstrate Nancy's value proposition.
