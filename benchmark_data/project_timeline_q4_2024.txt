Project Timeline Update - Q4 2024

PROJECT PHASE: Q4 2024 Integration Phase
PROJECT MANAGER: Scott Johnson
DURATION: October 1 - December 31, 2024

Critical path analysis:
1. Thermal analysis completion → Electrical design → Mechanical integration
2. Dependencies identified between all three subsystems
3. Cross-functional collaboration essential for success

DECISION: Adopt integrated design approach
DECISION MAKER: Scott Johnson
CONTEXT: Individual subsystem optimization insufficient
INFLUENCED BY: Integration challenges discovered in thermal-electrical interface
RESULTED IN: Weekly cross-team design reviews, shared milestone tracking

Team expertise mapping:
- Sarah Chen: PRIMARY thermal design expert, SECONDARY mechanical integration
- Mike Rodriguez: PRIMARY electrical design expert, SECONDARY power management  
- Lisa Park: PRIMARY mechanical design expert, SECONDARY materials selection
- Scott Johnson: PROJECT coordination expert, SECONDARY systems integration

MEETING SCHEDULE:
- Weekly design reviews (all teams)
- Bi-weekly thermal-electrical coordination (Sarah + Mike)
- Monthly mechanical integration check (Lisa + all)

PROJECT OUTCOME: Successful integration achieved through systematic cross-team collaboration
