Thermal Analysis Report - Q4 2024
                
DECISION: Adopt aluminum heat sink design
DECISION MAKER: Sarah Chen
CONTEXT: CPU temperatures exceeded 85Â°C during stress testing
INFLUENCED BY: Mike Rodriguez's electrical power analysis showing 15W TDP
AFFECTS: Mechanical enclosure design, electrical placement constraints
COLLABORATES WITH: Mike Rodriguez (electrical), Lisa Park (mechanical)
ERA: Q4 2024 Design Phase

Key findings:
- Current copper solution insufficient for sustained loads
- Aluminum provides 40% better heat dissipation per cost
- Requires 2mm additional clearance for airflow
- Integration with electrical layout critical for effectiveness

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINT: Heat sink placement CONSTRAINS electrical component layout
FEATURE IMPACT: Enhanced cooling ENABLES higher performance modes
