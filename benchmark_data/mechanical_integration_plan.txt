Mechanical Integration Plan - Q4 2024

DECISION: Redesign enclosure with 15% larger volume
DECISION MAKER: Lisa Park
CONTEXT: Accommodate aluminum heat sink and split power rail requirements
INFLUENCED BY: Sarah Chen's thermal requirements, Mike Rodriguez's electrical spacing needs
ERA: Q4 2024 Integration Phase

Design changes:
- Enclosure height increased by 3mm for heat sink clearance
- Internal partitioning modified for split power rail layout
- Airflow channels optimized based on thermal analysis
- Material changed to ABS for better heat dissipation

COLLABORATION: Lisa Park COORDINATED WITH Sarah Chen and Mike Rodriguez
CROSS-TEAM IMPACT: Mechanical changes ENABLE both thermal and electrical optimizations
FEATURE: Optimized enclosure design OWNED BY Lisa Park
TIMELINE: Mechanical changes ADD 2 weeks to project schedule
