EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document establishes thermal design constraints for the IoT device enclosure based on component power dissipation analysis and environmental requirements.

THERMAL DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
1. Maximum Surface Temperature: 50°C
   - Based on user safety requirements for handheld operation
   - Complies with IEC 62368-1 safety standards
   - Critical for industrial design acceptance

2. Internal Temperature Rise Limits
   - Processor: Junction temp <105°C (25°C margin from max rating)
   - Power management IC: <85°C case temperature
   - RF components: <70°C to maintain performance
   - Battery compartment: <60°C to prevent thermal runaway

3. Heat Dissipation Requirements
   - Primary heat source: Power management IC (1.8W max dissipation)
   - Secondary: Processor during peak processing (0.5W)
   - Total system heat generation: 2.5W maximum

THERMAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS
1. Enclosure Material Selection
   - Aluminum alloy 6061-T6 recommended for base plate
   - Thermal conductivity: 167 W/m·K
   - Provides heat spreading and external convection

2. Internal Heat Management
   - Thermal interface material between IC and enclosure
   - Copper pour on PCB for heat spreading
   - Component placement optimization for thermal isolation

3. Airflow Considerations
   - Natural convection design (no fans)
   - Ventilation slots sized for IP65 compliance
   - Orientation-independent thermal performance

IMPACT ON OTHER SYSTEMS
- Mechanical design must accommodate thermal interface materials
- Electrical layout constrained by thermal isolation requirements
- Industrial design affected by ventilation slot placement
- Material selection impacts cost and manufacturing processes

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
- Thermal simulation using ANSYS Icepak
- Physical prototype testing across temperature range
- Accelerated aging tests at elevated temperatures
- Field testing in target environments

Critical interfaces with electrical team (Mike Rodriguez) on power IC placement.
Coordination required with mechanical team on enclosure thermal paths.
Industrial design team (Lisa Park) consulted on aesthetic impact of thermal features.
