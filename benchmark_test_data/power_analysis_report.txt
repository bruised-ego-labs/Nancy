EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides detailed power consumption analysis for the IoT device across all operational modes, supporting the system requirement of 2.5W maximum power consumption and 5-year battery life target.

POWER CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN

ACTIVE MODE (Continuous Operation)
Total Power: 2.4W (within 2.5W requirement)

Component-level Analysis:
- Processor (ARM Cortex-M4): 850mW during full processing
- WiFi Radio (2.4GHz): 620mW during transmission
- Bluetooth Radio: 180mW during active connection
- Sensor Interface: 320mW during data acquisition
- Power Management IC: 180mW (self-consumption)
- LED Indicators: 45mW (all active)
- Miscellaneous (clocks, references): 205mW

SLEEP MODE (Low Power Standby)
Total Power: 8.5μW (well below 10μW requirement)

Component-level Analysis:
- Processor (sleep mode): 2.1μW
- WiFi Radio (powered down): 0μW
- Bluetooth (beacon mode): 4.2μW
- Real-time clock: 1.8μW
- Power management (quiescent): 0.4μW

BATTERY LIFE CALCULATIONS

CR2032 Battery Specifications:
- Nominal capacity: 220mAh at 3V
- Usable capacity: 200mAh (accounting for voltage drop)
- End-of-life voltage: 2.7V

Operating Profile Analysis:
- Active mode: 10% duty cycle (2.4 hours/day)
- Sleep mode: 90% duty cycle (21.6 hours/day)

Average Current Consumption:
- Active: 800mA × 0.10 = 80mA (average contribution)
- Sleep: 2.83mA × 0.90 = 2.55mA (average contribution)
- Total average: 82.55mA

Battery Life Calculation:
200mAh ÷ 82.55mA = 2,425 hours = 101 days

DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS
Current calculation shows 101 days vs 5-year requirement (1,825 days).

Root Cause: Operating profile assumptions incorrect for target application.

REVISED OPERATING PROFILE (Field Deployment)
Based on customer usage patterns from Lisa Park's research:

- Active mode: 1% duty cycle (14.4 minutes/day)
- Sleep mode: 99% duty cycle (23.77 hours/day)

Revised Average Current:
- Active: 800mA × 0.01 = 8mA
- Sleep: 2.83mA × 0.99 = 2.80mA  
- Total average: 10.8mA

Revised Battery Life:
200mAh ÷ 10.8mA = 18,519 hours = 772 days = 2.1 years

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 5-YEAR TARGET

Hardware Optimizations:
1. Implement wake-on-radio for reduced monitoring power
2. Use lower power processor variant (reduces active current to 600mA)
3. Optimize sensor power sequencing (reduces active current by 100mA)
4. Implement adaptive transmission power control

Firmware Optimizations:
1. Aggressive CPU clock scaling during low-activity periods
2. Intelligent sensor polling based on activity detection
3. Batch data transmission to reduce radio active time
4. Deep sleep optimization with faster wake-up sequences

OPTIMIZED POWER BUDGET
With recommended optimizations:

Active Mode: 1.8W (25% reduction)
- Processor: 600mW (optimized variant)
- WiFi Radio: 620mW (unchanged)
- Bluetooth: 180mW (unchanged) 
- Sensors: 220mW (power sequencing)
- Power Management: 135mW (improved efficiency)
- LED/Misc: 245mW (unchanged)

Sleep Mode: 6.2μW (27% reduction)
- Processor deep sleep: 1.2μW
- Wake-on-radio: 3.1μW
- RTC: 1.8μW
- Quiescent current: 0.1μW

FINAL BATTERY LIFE PROJECTION
Optimized average current: 7.8mA
Battery life: 200mAh ÷ 7.8mA = 25,641 hours = 1,068 days = 2.9 years

Gap Analysis: Still 2.1 years short of 5-year target.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
1. Larger battery (2×CR2032 or rechargeable Li-ion)
2. Energy harvesting (solar, vibration, thermal)
3. Reduced functionality mode for extended operation
4. Field-replaceable battery design

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Prototype power measurement across full temperature range
2. Accelerated battery drain testing
3. Real-world usage pattern validation with customers
4. Power optimization firmware validation

This analysis demonstrates the need for both hardware and firmware optimization to approach the 5-year battery life target. Coordination with electrical team (Mike Rodriguez) required for hardware changes and mechanical team (David Kim) for battery compartment design.
