Voice of Customer Research Summary
Project: Advanced IoT Device Development
Author: Lisa Park
Date: March 12, 2024

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
- 45 customer interviews across target segments
- 120 survey responses from existing product users
- 8 focus group sessions (6-8 participants each)
- Competitive analysis of 12 similar products
- Field observation studies in 5 customer environments

KEY CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

USABILITY CONCERNS
"The device needs to work immediately out of the box. I don't want to spend 30 minutes reading manuals." - Manufacturing Engineer, Automotive Industry

"The interface should be intuitive enough that any technician can operate it without training." - Maintenance Manager, Food Processing

"LED indicators must be visible in bright industrial lighting conditions." - Field Service Technician

DURABILITY REQUIREMENTS
"These devices get dropped, bumped, and exposed to harsh conditions. If it breaks after a few months, we won't buy again." - Plant Operations Manager

"Water and dust protection is non-negotiable in our environment." - Mining Operations Supervisor

"The device needs to survive being thrown in a toolbox with other equipment." - HVAC Technician

CONNECTIVITY PREFERENCES
"WiFi setup should be as simple as scanning a QR code." - IT Manager, Manufacturing

"I need to know immediately if the device loses connection to our system." - Remote Monitoring Specialist

"Battery life is critical - we can't have devices dying in the middle of important monitoring periods." - Environmental Consultant

FORM FACTOR FEEDBACK
"Smaller is better, but not at the expense of durability." - Field Engineer

"The device should attach easily to existing equipment without permanent modifications." - Facilities Manager

"Weight matters when technicians carry multiple devices." - Service Technician

VISUAL DESIGN PREFERENCES
Focus Group Finding: 78% preferred clean, minimalist design over feature-rich interfaces
Color Preference: Professional gray/black color schemes rated highest
Branding: Subtle company branding preferred over prominent logos

USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
Single Button Operation: "One button should handle 90% of what I need to do"
Status Feedback: "I need to know device status at a glance from across the room"
Error Indication: "When something goes wrong, make it obvious what the problem is"

MOUNTING AND INSTALLATION
"Magnetic mounting is preferred for steel surfaces"
"Screw mounting should use standard fasteners available anywhere"
"Installation should be possible with basic tools"
"Device orientation shouldn't affect performance"

COST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Price Point Acceptance:
- <$200: 89% would consider purchase
- $200-$350: 67% would consider purchase  
- $350-$500: 34% would consider purchase
- >$500: 12% would consider purchase

Value Drivers (in priority order):
1. Reliability and durability
2. Battery life
3. Ease of use
4. Connectivity options
5. Size and weight

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
Customer Pain Points with Existing Solutions:
- "Battery life claims are often overstated"
- "Setup process is too complicated"
- "Devices fail in harsh environments"
- "Customer support is difficult to reach"
- "Firmware updates break existing functionality"

DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
1. Interface Design: Single button with multi-color LED status indication
2. Enclosure: IP65 rating minimum, drop-resistant corners
3. Size Target: Palm-sized or smaller for portability
4. Weight Target: <150g including battery
5. Color Scheme: Professional charcoal gray with accent lighting
6. Mounting: Multiple options including magnetic and screw-mount
7. Setup Process: QR code or NFC-based configuration
8. Status Communication: Clear visual and audible feedback

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT TEAM
1. Prioritize durability over advanced features in design tradeoffs
2. Implement extensive drop and environmental testing
3. Design for single-handed operation
4. Ensure LED visibility in various lighting conditions
5. Minimize setup steps to absolute essentials
6. Plan for field serviceability and battery replacement

Customer feedback sessions coordinated with project management team.
Technical feasibility reviewed with systems engineering (Sarah Chen).
Cost implications discussed with electrical team (Mike Rodriguez).

This research provides clear direction for industrial design decisions that align with real customer needs and usage patterns.
