Design Review Meeting Transcript
Project: Advanced IoT Device Development
Date: March 22, 2024
Location: Conference Room B / Virtual
Chair: Jennifer Adams (Project Manager)
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Systems), Mike Rodriguez (Electrical), Lisa Park (Industrial Design), Tom Wilson (Firmware), David Kim (Mechanical), Mark Thompson (QA)

MEETING CALLED TO ORDER: 9:00 AM

Jennifer Adams: "Good morning everyone. This is our critical design review for the IoT device project. We need to make final decisions on several key items today to stay on schedule for prototype delivery in May."

AGENDA ITEM 1: BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND COST ANALYSIS
Jennifer Adams: "Let's start with the budget reality check. Finance has confirmed our target cost of $180 per unit for the first production run of 10,000 units."

David Kim: "The aluminum enclosure is pushing us over budget. Current quote is $35 per unit. If we switch to engineered plastic with metal insert, we can get it down to $22."

Lisa Park: "I'm concerned about the perceived quality with plastic. Customer research showed strong preference for metal construction in industrial environments."

Sarah Chen: "From a thermal perspective, we can make plastic work, but we'll need to add internal heat spreaders. That might offset some cost savings."

Mike Rodriguez: "The electrical impact is minimal. We just need to ensure adequate EMC shielding with the plastic approach."

DECISION: Investigate hybrid approach - plastic enclosure with aluminum heat spreader. Target cost reduction of $8 per unit.

AGENDA ITEM 2: POWER CONSUMPTION OPTIMIZATION
Sarah Chen: "We're still slightly over our 2.5W power budget. Current measurements show 2.7W during peak transmission."

Tom Wilson: "Firmware can implement aggressive power management. I can reduce processor clock during low-activity periods, saving approximately 200mW."

Mike Rodriguez: "The new power management IC I selected provides 90% efficiency. Combined with Tom's firmware optimizations, we should hit 2.4W maximum."

Sarah Chen: "That gives us 100mW margin for component tolerance and aging. I'm comfortable with that."

DECISION: Proceed with new power management IC and firmware optimizations. Target 2.4W maximum consumption.

AGENDA ITEM 3: MANUFACTURING TIMELINE CONCERNS
Jennifer Adams: "Manufacturing lead times are extending due to global supply chain issues. Some components now have 16-week lead times."

Mike Rodriguez: "I've identified alternate sources for the critical RF components. We can dual-source to mitigate risk, though it adds $3 per unit."

David Kim: "Tooling for the enclosure will take 8 weeks minimum. We need to freeze the mechanical design by April 1st."

Lisa Park: "Industrial design is 95% complete. Just finalizing LED light guide geometry."

DECISION: Authorize dual-sourcing for critical components. Freeze mechanical design by April 1st. Add 2-week buffer to manufacturing timeline.

AGENDA ITEM 4: TESTING AND VALIDATION STRATEGY
Mark Thompson: "We need to discuss accelerated life testing strategy. Customer requirements specify 5-year minimum operational life."

Sarah Chen: "Thermal cycling tests should stress the system at 85Â°C for equivalent aging. I recommend 1000 hours minimum."

Mike Rodriguez: "EMC testing is complete and passing. We should plan for pre-compliance testing on the final mechanical design."

Tom Wilson: "Firmware has automated test suites covering 90% of functionality. We need field testing scenarios for the remaining edge cases."

DECISION: Implement 1000-hour accelerated aging test. Schedule pre-compliance EMC testing for final prototype. Develop field testing protocol.

AGENDA ITEM 5: RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Jennifer Adams: "Let's review our top risks and mitigation plans."

Risk 1: Supply chain delays
Mitigation: Dual-sourcing critical components, maintain 4-week inventory buffer

Risk 2: Thermal performance in worst-case environments
Mitigation: Extended thermal testing, design margin validation

Risk 3: Customer acceptance of plastic enclosure
Mitigation: Premium feel through texture and finish, metal accent features

Risk 4: Manufacturing yield issues
Mitigation: Design for manufacturing review, pilot production run

AGENDA ITEM 6: CUSTOMER VALIDATION FEEDBACK
Lisa Park: "Customer feedback from prototype demos has been very positive. Key concerns are around setup complexity and battery life indication."

Tom Wilson: "I can implement a setup wizard in firmware that walks users through configuration step-by-step."

Mike Rodriguez: "Battery life indication requires fuel gauge IC. Adds $2 per unit but provides accurate percentage remaining."

DECISION: Implement setup wizard in firmware. Evaluate fuel gauge IC cost/benefit with finance team.
