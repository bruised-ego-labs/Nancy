Electrical Design Review Meeting Transcript
Project: Advanced IoT Device Development
Date: March 18, 2024
Attendees: Mike Rodriguez (Electrical Lead), Sarah Chen (Systems), Lisa Park (Industrial Design), Tom Wilson (Firmware), Jennifer Adams (Project Manager)

AGENDA ITEM 1: POWER SUPPLY DESIGN REVIEW
Mike Rodriguez: "The power supply schematic v3 has been updated based on Sarah's thermal constraints. We've moved the switching regulator to the edge of the PCB for better heat dissipation."

Sarah Chen: "Good. The thermal analysis shows this placement reduces junction temperature by 12°C compared to the center placement. This gives us margin for the 50°C surface temperature requirement."

Mike Rodriguez: "I've also added the thermal vias as discussed. The power consumption should now meet the 2.5W maximum even during worst-case scenarios."

AGENDA ITEM 2: EMC COMPLIANCE STATUS
Mike Rodriguez: "EMC testing results from the lab show we're passing FCC Part 15 Class B limits with 6dB margin. The new ground plane design and ferrite beads on the power lines resolved the previous failures."

Jennifer Adams: "Excellent. That removes a major risk from our timeline. When can we get the CE certification testing scheduled?"

Mike Rodriguez: "Test lab has availability next week. I'll coordinate with the mechanical team since we need the final enclosure design for radiated emissions testing."

AGENDA ITEM 3: POWER MANAGEMENT IC CONCERNS
Sarah Chen: "I've been reviewing the power management IC specifications. Under worst-case conditions, the efficiency drops to 82%, which pushes our power consumption above the 2.5W target."

Mike Rodriguez: "I've identified an alternative IC with 90% efficiency across the full operating range. It's slightly more expensive but keeps us within power budget."

Tom Wilson: "Will this change affect the firmware power management algorithms?"

Mike Rodriguez: "Minimal impact. The enable/disable timing is identical, and the voltage regulation is actually more stable."

AGENDA ITEM 4: RF PERFORMANCE VALIDATION
Mike Rodriguez: "The antenna matching network has been optimized. We're achieving -92dBm sensitivity, which exceeds the -90dBm requirement by 2dB."

Lisa Park: "How does the antenna placement affect the industrial design? We need to maintain the clean aesthetic while optimizing RF performance."

Mike Rodriguez: "The antenna is now integrated into the side wall of the enclosure. It's invisible from the outside but maintains good radiation patterns."

AGENDA ITEM 5: COMPONENT PLACEMENT OPTIMIZATION
Mike Rodriguez: "Based on thermal feedback from Sarah, I've relocated high-power components away from temperature-sensitive circuits. The crystal oscillator is now in a thermally stable zone."

Sarah Chen: "That placement looks good. It should maintain ±20ppm accuracy across the full temperature range."

ACTION ITEMS:
1. Mike to finalize power management IC selection by March 22
2. Schedule CE certification testing for March 25
3. Update power supply schematic to v4 with final IC selection
4. Coordinate with mechanical team on final enclosure design for EMC testing
5. Validate firmware power management with new IC specifications

DECISIONS MADE:
- Approved power management IC change for better efficiency
- Confirmed antenna placement strategy
- Agreed on component placement optimization for thermal management

Meeting Notes: The electrical design is progressing well with good integration between thermal, mechanical, and industrial design requirements. The power supply architecture changes should resolve both efficiency and thermal concerns while maintaining EMC compliance.
