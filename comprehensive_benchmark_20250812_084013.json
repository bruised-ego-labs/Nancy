This decision was influenced by Sarah Chen's thermal requirements and Mike Rodriguez's electrical spacing needs.\n*   **Electrical Design:** A split power rail design was implemented to address thermal constraints requiring component spacing optimization. This resulted in component placement redesign and power efficiency improvements.\n*   **Thermal Analysis:** The decision to adopt an aluminum heat sink design was made because CPU temperatures exceeded 85\u00b0C during stress testing. This decision impacted the mechanical enclosure design and electrical placement constraints and collaborated with Mike Rodriguez (electrical) and Lisa Park (mechanical).\n\nThermal considerations are central to the mechanical and electrical designs. Sarah Chen's thermal analysis and requirements influenced both the mechanical enclosure redesign and the electrical split power rail design. The thermal analysis report directly led to the adoption of the aluminum heat sink.\n",
