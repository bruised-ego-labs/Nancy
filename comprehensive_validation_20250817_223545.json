For example, the decision to adopt an integrated design approach stemmed from integration challenges in the thermal-electrical interface. The split power rail design was implemented due to thermal constraints and hotspot risks.\n*   **Cross-Team Influence:** Decisions are frequently influenced by other teams' expertise and findings. The adoption of an integrated design approach was influenced by Sarah Chen's thermal analysis. The split power rail design was influenced by Sarah Chen's thermal analysis.\n*   **Dependency-Aware:** The project timeline highlights dependencies between subsystems, indicating that decisions are made with these dependencies in mind. The critical path analysis emphasizes the interconnectedness of thermal analysis, electrical design, and mechanical integration.\n*   **Systematic Review:** There is a structured review process involving weekly design reviews (all teams), bi-weekly thermal-electrical coordination (Sarah + Mike), and monthly mechanical integration checks (Lisa + all).\n\n**Key Decision Makers:**\n\n*   **Scott Johnson:** Project coordination expert and project manager. He made the decision to adopt the integrated design approach.\n*   **Mike Rodriguez:** Primary electrical design expert. He made the decision to implement the split power rail design.\n*   **Sarah Chen:** Primary thermal design expert. Her analysis influenced decisions on both the integrated design approach and the split power rail design.\n\n"

The CPU temperatures exceeded 85\u00b0C during stress testing, and Mike Rodriguez's electrical power analysis showing a 15W TDP influenced the heat sink decision.\n\nThe approach involved collaboration between electrical (Mike Rodriguez), thermal (Sarah Chen), and mechanical (Lisa Park) teams. Weekly cross-team design reviews were implemented as part of an integrated design approach (Scott Johnson, DECISION MAKER) to address integration challenges. Bi-weekly thermal-electrical coordination meetings (Sarah + Mike) and monthly mechanical integration checks (Lisa + all) were also scheduled.\n\nMechanical changes, including an optimized enclosure design owned by Lisa Park, are expected to add 2 weeks to the project schedule.
